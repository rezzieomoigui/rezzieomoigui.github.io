    <h1>Capybaras: Adorable semi-aquatic Rodents</h1>

    <p>
        Capybaras are the largest rodents in the world and are native to South America. 
        They are semi-aquatic animals, meaning they spend time both on land and in water. 
        They are well known for their calm and friendly behavior around other animals. 
        Because of their gentle nature, they are often used in educational and zoo environments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Capybaras usually live in groups to help protect themselves from predators. 
        They eat mostly grasses and aquatic plants, making them herbivores. 
        Their webbed feet allow them to swim efficiently in rivers and lakes. 
        Studying capybaras helps scientists understand animal behavior and ecosystems.

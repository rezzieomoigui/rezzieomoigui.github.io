    <h2>The Beauty and Myth of Black Cats</h2>

    <p>
      Black cats have long been associated with mystery, luck, and folklore. Some cultures see them as bringers of good fortune, while others tie them to superstition and myth. Despite these stories, black cats are just as loving and playful as any other feline companions.

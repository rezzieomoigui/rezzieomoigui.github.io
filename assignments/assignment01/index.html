  <h1>Penguins: Cool Creatures of the Ice</h1>

  <p>
    Penguins are flightless birds that live mostly in the Southern Hemisphere. 
    They are known for their distinctive black and white coloring and their 
    waddling walk. Penguins are expert swimmers and spend a large part of 
    their life in the ocean. Their bodies are streamlined to help them move 
    quickly through water while hunting for fish.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are over 15 species of penguins, and not all of them live in icy 
    climates. Some species, like the Galápagos penguin, live in warm regions. 
    Penguins are social animals that live in colonies, and many species mate 
    for life. Their unique appearance and behaviors make them popular animals 
    in documentaries and zoos around the world.
